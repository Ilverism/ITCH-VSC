## About ITCH-VSC (Inline Tag Context Hider for VS Code)

ITCH-VSC is a VS Code extension used to collapse user-defined inline tags so that only the inner content is visible while viewing a file.
When the content is being edited or selected, the collapsed 'context' (e.g., inner and outer HTML tags) will automatically expand.

The original purpose of this extension was to support my web-based visual novel engine,
and the ability to have inline-styled content while retaining readability was important.

## Installation

...

## Features

- Easily configurable to support different tags
- Built-in helper function to support HTML tags
- Modifiable styling for folded tags (e.g., text color, font weight, content marker, etc.)
- Exclude commented content from being folded (❗ Toggleable, ON by default)
- Support multi-line folds (❗ Toggleable, OFF by default)

## Configuration

- Use the existing ```foldconfig.ts``` file for configuration
- Create basic HTML tag Fold instances with the ```createHTMLFold(...)``` helper function
- Create custom Fold instances with calls to ```new Fold(...)```
- Fold instances are stored inside a static list, so there is no need to do any additional work with the created instances

## Usage

- Click or select a collapsed item to expand it
- Toggle certain functionality using the commands below
